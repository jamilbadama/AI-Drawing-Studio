Building a thoughtful community starts with clear expectations. Here is how we show up for one another.

## How to Engage

- **Be respectful**: critique ideas, not people.
- **Share value**: add data points, examples, or resources that move the conversation forward.
- **Stay on topic**: keep comments relevant to the post you are responding to.

## Moderation Approach

We review new comments daily. Posts that are promotional, harmful, or spam will be removed immediately. Repeat violations may lead to account suspension.

If you ever feel unsafe or see something that violates these guidelines, contact us directly and we will respond within 24 hours.
