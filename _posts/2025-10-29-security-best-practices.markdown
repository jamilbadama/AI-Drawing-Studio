Security is everyone’s responsibility. Here are the core practices we recommend to protect your account and the stories you publish here.

## Recommended Steps

- **Enable two-factor authentication** wherever possible.
- **Use a password manager** so every credential is strong and unique.
- **Review active sessions** monthly and revoke access you no longer need.

## Incident Response

If you suspect suspicious activity, email us right away. We will temporarily lock access, investigate, and provide status updates within the first 12 hours.
